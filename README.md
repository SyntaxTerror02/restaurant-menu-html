# 🍔 Simple Restaurant Menu Website

This is a beginner-friendly **HTML project** based on [Dave Gray's YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/T5PD8ofhiug?si=NYfHPGNqWFenvlmF).  
It showcases a basic restaurant menu layout using only HTML and **pre-written minimal CSS** provided in the tutorial files.

> 📌 This was part of my hands-on learning journey to escape "tutorial hell" by actually building instead of just watching.
